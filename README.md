# Book-Library
Book library is part of The Odin Project Curriculum where Learner has to apply knowledge and skills acquire through the TOP to build some Hands-on project in JavaScript. Simple Book Management Library that allow you to create and delete book as you read. I used cdn to replace css on this project. Used of cdn meant to save some time, but icould benefit from using CSS from scratch though.
Cdn was use on this project to reduce css manupulation but javascript has been heavily use for implementation. User can added books into library, deleted books and checked books as read. Reader is able to added, delete or bookmark Books that have been read. Javacript is heavily used with implementation on tis project. Readeer will have a choice to bookmark, deleted or selected another book for reading list. Book libbrary will be recreated with differnt framework on market starinting with most popular one. First Project will be with Vue Framework and React will folowed that. Sample Book-Library to manage Books. Users can delete, check read books or select book for furture reading.
